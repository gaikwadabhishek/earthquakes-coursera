# earthquakes-coursera
This project was made by me for applying the concepts of OOP that I learned from the course "Object Oriented Programming in Java" by UCSD on Coursera. In this project, I am fetching live data of earthquakes and then giving user ability to filter earthquakes based of various mouse and keyboard interrupts
